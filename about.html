      <h2>Pizza Histtory</h2>
      <p>The origin of the word "Pizza" is uncertain. The food was invented in Naples about 200 years ago. It is the name for a special type of flatbread, made with special dough.
        The pizza enjoyed a second birth as it was taken to the United States in the late 19th century. Pizza was brought to the United States with Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century; and first appeared in areas where Italian immigrants concentrated. 
        The country's first pizzeria (place that focuses in pizza), Lombardi's, opened in 1905. Veterans returning from World War II's Italian Campaign were a ready market for pizza. Since then, pizza consumption has increased in the U.S includding other coutries. 
        Pizza chains such as Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's, have outlets all over the nation.</p>

          <h2>Pizza Varieties By Countries </h2>
          <p> In Italy, Authentic Neapolitan pizzas (pizza napoletana) are typically made with tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. 
            They can be made with ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes, which grow on the volcanic plains to the south of Mount Vesuvius, and mozzarella di bufala Campana, made with the milk from water buffalo raised in the marshlands of Campania and Lazio in a semi-wild state (this mozzarella is protected with its own European protected designation of origin)
            In Hungary, Hungarians enjoy most of the traditional pizza toppings, but there are some unique local varieties, including "Magyaros" ("Hungarian-style") pizza, which usually has toppings like bacon, kolbász (Hungarian sausage), salami, hot peppers, and red onion.[25] "White pizza" (see below) is also popular, especially because it is similar to Hungarian kenyérlángos or langalló (it is a type of flatbread often topped with sour cream, bacon and onions)</p>

          <h2>Pizza Margherita</h2>
          <p> is a typical Neapolitan pizza, roundish in shape with a raised edge (the cornicione) and garnished with hand-crushed peeled tomatoes, mozzarella (buffalo mozzarella or fior di latte), fresh basil leaves, and extra virgin olive oil. 
            The dough is made by mixing water, salt and yeast (sourdough, fresh or dry brewer's yeast) with flour.
            Traditionally, the dough is stretched by the pizzaiolo in a motion going outwards from the center, pressing with the fingers of both hands on the dough ball, and flipping it several times, shaping it into a disc. Thereafter, it is topped and baked in an oven, which is traditionally made of brick and wood-fired (electric or gas ovens are also used nowadays).
            Pizza Margherita is usually served hot on a plate or folded into four and wrapped in paper (pizza a portafoglio or a libretto). </p>
